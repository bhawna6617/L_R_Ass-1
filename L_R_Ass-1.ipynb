    "\n",
    "# Logistic regression is used when the target variable is categorical, typically binary (i.e., it has two possible outcomes).\n",
    "# It models the probability of the outcome occurring as a function of the independent variables.\n",
    "# The output of logistic regression is a probability score between 0 and 1, which represents the likelihood of the event happening.\n",

    "# Let's consider a scenario where you are predicting whether a customer will churn (i.e., leave) a subscription service based on various features such as age, gender, usage patterns, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Linear Regression: If you were to use linear regression for this scenario, you might end up predicting churn probabilities that exceed 1 or fall below 0, which doesn't make sense because probabilities must be between 0 and 1.\n",
    "# Logistic Regression: On the other hand, logistic regression would be more appropriate because it models the probability of churn as a function of the input features, ensuring that the output probabilities are within the valid range of 0 to 1. You can interpret these probabilities as the likelihood of a customer churning, and you can set a threshold (e.g., 0.5) to classify customers into churners and non-churners based on these probabilities.\n",
